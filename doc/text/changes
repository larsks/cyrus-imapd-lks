Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.4.5

      * Fixed Bug #3370 - corruption on OpenBSD and other systems without a
        reliable mmap 
      * Fixed Bug #3360 - race condition which could lose seen data on XFER
        with upgrade 
      * Lots of documentation updates 
      * Fixed Bug #3355 - added an option to suppress items from the
        capability response (and bug #3356 when the first attempt was
        buggy) 
      * Fixed Bug #3357 - crash when calling ctl_mboxlist on mailboxes with
        annotations 
      * Fixed Bug #3369 - crash when undumping mailbox during XFER 
      * Fixed Bug #3361 - shared folders not listing in LSUB "" % - only
        with unixheirsep and altnamespace 
      * Fixed Bug #3362 - "too many open files" when doing XFER of a user
        with too many sub mailboxes. Makes XFER less "atomic", but now it
        works, which is good! 
      * Fixed Bug #3313 - md5 library usage. Properly this time!
