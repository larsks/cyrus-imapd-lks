<h1>Cyrus IMAP Server: Replication Protocol</h1>

<h2>Replication Wire protocol : types</h2>
<pre>
ulong::
  Unsigned long integer 0 <= x <= (2^32)-1

quota_t:: 
  EITHER : Unsigned long integer      :: 0 <= x <= (2^32)-1
      OR : Unsigned long long integer :: 0 <= x <= (2^64)-1

time_t::
  Timestamp (currently 32 bit unsigned integer, offset into Unix epoch)

literal+::
  {count+}\r\n
Arbitrary string of count bytes\r\n

astring::
  Atom or string

qstring::
  Quoted string

flag_list_t
  List of system and user flags of the form: (\Deleted \Answered Hello World)
</pre>

<h3>Return values</h3>

<p>Each command sent to the server is a single logical line of arbitrary length
(literal encoding may make the single logical line span multiple lines).<p>

<p>Responses follow the IMAP three state module:</p>

 OK English text\r\n   -- Operation completed okay
 NO English text\r\n   -- Operation failed: reason attached
BAD English text\r\n   -- replication protocol error.

<h3>Unsolicited/Multiline responses</h3>

<p>Some commands generate responses which span multiple lines. The final line
in the response will start "OK", "NO", or "BAD". Intermediate lines will
all start "*". Some commands may generate structured responses (e.g: a list
of mailboxes plus all of their contents) where the number of "*" at the
start of the line defines the structure of the response.</p>

<h2>Replication Wire Protocol : Brief text descriptions</h2>

<p>The replication protocol defines 32 verbs at the time of writing.</p>

<hr>
<h4>ADDSUB</h4>
<pre>  subscription :: astring</pre>

Add string to list of subscription on server.

<hr>
<h4>ACTIVATE_SIEVE</h4>
<pre>  sieve_name :: astring</pre>

Activate sieve file of given name for this user.

<hr>
<h4>CREATE</h4>
<pre>
  mailboxname :: astring  -- e.g: user.dpc22.zzz
  uniqueid    :: astring  -- Cyrus UniqueID (currently 64bit hex number)
  acl         :: astring  -- Initial ACL for this mailbox
  mbtype      :: int      
  uidvalidity :: ulong
</pre>

Create mailbox with given name. UniqueID currently derived from
UIDvalidity and mailbox name, but no guarantee that this will always
be the case.

Special value "NIL" for ACL means that mailbox has come from UW world or
some other location without ACL. We construct appropriate default ACL:

<pre>
     userid    --> "lrswipcda" 
     anonymous --> "0"           (for FUD daemon)
</pre>  

<hr>
<h4>CONTENTS</h4>

Dump complete contents of current folder to output screen. Used for
downloading messages from Cyrus into UW world.

Response is series of lines of the form:

<pre>
  * [uid] [internaldate] 
    [flags :: flag_list_t]
    [message body :: literal]
</pre>

followed by final "OK" line. flag_list includes \Seen state for current
users, unlike STATUS, USER_ALL and USER_SOME.

<hr>
<h4>DEACTIVATE_SIEVE</h4>

Deactivate the active sieve file for this user.

<hr>
<h4>DELETE</h4>
<pre>  mailbox :: astring.</pre>

Delete mailbox with given name.

<hr>
<h4>DELSUB</h4>
<pre>  mailbox :: astring</pre>

Delete subscription with given name

<hr>
<h4>DELETE_SIEVE</h4>
<pre>  sieve_name :: astring</pre>

Delete sieve file with given name.

<hr>
<h4>EXIT</h4>

Shut down sync_server

<hr>
<h4>EXPUNGE</h4>
<pre>
  uid0 :: ulong
     . . .
  uidn :: ulong
</pre>

Remove messages matching given list of UIDS from currently selected
folder. Will return single line "OK Expunge Complete" on success.

<hr>
<h4>ENDUSER</h4>

Unlock current user  and call auth_freestate() to discard current
authentication.

<hr>
<h4>GET_SIEVE sieve_name :: astring</h4>

Get sieve script with given name. Successful response is of form:

<pre>
OK {%lu+}\r\n
Sieve script
\r\n
</pre>

<hr>
<h4>INFO</h4> 

Get meta information for currently selected folder. Response is single line
of the form:

<pre>
OK
  UIDvalidity :: ulong
  UIDlast     :: ulong
  Flags       :: flag_list_t
</pre>

"INFO" command is almost certainly historical baggage and should be removed.

<hr>
<h4>LIST</h4>

List mail folders for currently selected list. Multiline response of
the form:

<pre>
   * [Uniqueid :: astring] [Name :: astring] [Acl :: astring]
      . . .
   * [Uniqueid :: astring] [Name :: astring] [Acl :: astring]
   OK List complete
</pre>

List command probably obsolete with advent of USER_ALL and USER_SOME
commands.

<hr>
<h4>LSUB</h4>

List subscriptions for currently selected user. Multiline response of the
form:

<pre>
   * [Subscription :: astring]
     . . .
   * [Subscription :: astring]
   OK Lsub complete
</pre>

<hr>
<h4>LIST_SIEVE</h4>

List available sieve files for currently selected users. Multiline
response of the form:

<pre>
   * [Sieve_name :: astring]   [*]   <-- "*" for active sieve file
     . . .
   * [Sieve_name :: astring]
   OK List_sieve complete
</pre>

<hr>
<h4>QUOTA</h4>
<pre>  quota_root :: astring</pre>

Get quota root information. Response is single line of the form:

<pre>
OK
  Limit                 :: quota_t   (Kbytes)
  Expunged_timeout      :: ulong     (seconds) 
  Expunged_vol_min      :: quota_t   (KBytes)
  Expunged_vol_max      :: quota_t   (KBytes)
  Expunged_vol_overflow :: quota_t   (KBytes)
  Mailbox_limit         :: ulong     (KBytes)
</pre>

<hr>
<h4>RENAME</h4>
<pre>
  old_name :: astring
  new_name :: astring
</pre>

Rename mailbox old_name --> new_name

<hr>
<h4>RESET</h4>
<pre>  account :: astring</pre>

Reset named account back to initial state. Wipes all of the following:
<ul>
<li>mailboxes</li>
<li>subscriptions</li>
<li>seen data</li>
<li>Sieve files.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h4>RESERVE</h4>
<pre>
  mailbox :: astring
  guid0 :: ulong
     . . .
  guidn :: ulong
</pre>

Reserves collection of messages matching list of GUIDs in given mailbox.
Message data is linked into /var/spool/imap/sync. staging directory
so that we can later link the messages into other folders even if the
original has been expunged. Multiline response of the form:

<pre>
  * [GUID :: astring]
    . . .
  * [GUID :: astring]
  OK Reserve complete
</pre>

so that client knows which reserve operations have been complete and which
have failed.

<hr>
<h4>RESTART</h4>

sync_client wants to negotiate a restart to clear up. Clears out all staged
messages causes by upload and reserve sync_server child process exits
cleanly, parent forks off a new child to resolve any memory leaks.

Responds:
<pre>
OK restarting.
</pre>

<hr>
<h4>SELECT</h4>
<pre>  mailbox :: astring</pre>

Select named mailbox as current folder (calls mailbox_open()).

<hr>
<h4>STATUS</h4>

Return complete status of currently selected mailbox. Multiline response:

<pre>
  * [uid :: ulong] [guid :: astring] [flags :: flag_list]
    . . .
  * [uid :: ulong] [guid :: astring] [flags :: flag_list]
  OK [last_uid :: ulong]
</pre>

Believe that this command has been obsoleted by USER_ALL and USER_SOME.
Occasionally useful for debugging purposes.

<hr>
<h4>SETFLAGS</h4>
<pre>
  [
    uid   :: ulong
    flags :: flag_list_t     e.g: (\Deleted \Flagged Hello World)
  ] +
</pre>

Set flags for messages with given series of UIDs. SETFLAGS can take
an arbitrary number of "uid (flags) " pairs on a single line.

<hr>
<h4>SETSEEN</h4>
<pre>
  user       :: astring
  lastread   :: time_t
  lastuid    :: time_t
  lastchange :: time_t
  seenuid    :: astring
</pre>

Update seen database for current selected mailbox + nominated userid.
seenuid is opaque string used by seendb code. The replication engine
doesn't attempt to decompose seenuid strings to work out if anything
has changed, it just uses the lastchange timestamp to work out if
the seenuid string should be updated.

Successful Response:
<pre>
  OK Setseen Succeeded
</pre>

<hr>
<h4>SETACL</h4>
<pre>
  mailbox :: astring
  acl :: astring
</pre>

Set ACL on given mailbox. ACL will typically contain tab characters,
so the astring will be the quoted form e.g:

<pre>
  "dpc22\ttlrswipcda\tanonymous\t0\t"
</pre>

<hr>
<h4>SETQUOTA</h4>
<pre>
  quotaroot :: astring
  limit     :: quota_t
  expunged_timeout :: ulong
  expunged_vol_min :: ulong
  expunged_vol_max :: ulong
  expunged_vol_overflow :: ulong
  mailbox_limit         :: ulong     (KBytes)
</pre>

Set limits and overrides for given quota root.

<hr>
<h4>UPLOAD</h4>
<pre>
  newlastuid      :: ulong
  last_appenddate :: time_t
</pre>

  Arbitrary list of messages on single logical line , with three forms:

<pre>
   SIMPLE                          # Unparsed message that we need to parse
     GUID          :: astring
     UID           :: ulong        # "NIL" => Use GUID 0.
     internaldate  :: time_t
     sentdate      :: time_t
     last_updated  :: time_t
     flags         :: flag_list_t
     message_text  :: literal+

   PARSED                          # Message plus pre-parsed cyrus.cache entry
     GUID          :: astring
     UID           :: ulong
     internaldate  :: time_t
     sentdate      :: time_t
     last_updated  :: time_t
     flags         :: flag_list_t
     message_cache :: literal+
     message_text  :: literal+

   COPY                           # Copy of message which has already
     GUID          :: astring     # been UPLOADED or RESERVED
     UID           :: ulong       # Message body and cache available
     internaldate  :: time_t      # from staging directory
     sentdate      :: time_t
</pre>

Upload an arbitrary list of messages to the currently selected folder.

Will normally only add messages to the end of the mailfolder in current use
(and the code has special optimised path for that case).  However if
message list contains UIDs which belong in the middle of a mailbox, or a
given UID exists on both client and server but the GUID values don't match
(which normally indicates the two ends have lost sync with each other),
the the UPLOAD command will merge in new and replacement messages.

Response:
<pre>
  OK Upload %lu messages okay
</pre>

<hr>
<h4>UIDLAST</h4>
<pre>
  last_uid        :: ulong
  last_appenddate :: ulong
</pre>

Update last_uid and last_appenddate timestamps on mailfolder. Typically
used when new messages have been arrived and then been expunged between
replication runs. Essentially UPLOAD operation with an empty message list.

<hr>
<h4>USER</h4>
<pre>
  user ::astring 
</pre>

Select given user: locks out concurrent access from other replication
runners and calls auth_newstate to authenticate us as the user in question.

Response:
<pre>
  OK Locked [username]
</pre>

<hr>
<h4>USER_ALL</h4>
<pre>
  user ::astring 
</pre>

Select given user: locks out concurrent access from other replication
runners and calls auth_newstate to authenticate us as the user in question.

Response is a complete list of _everything_ in the target account on
the replica system in a single round trip. Multi line response,
with various kinds of "*" response indicating different objects.
Format should be familiar from other commands which examine only a
portion of the target account.

<pre>
**** Sieve script. Single line response of the form:

  **** [name :: astring]       
       [last_update :: time_t] 
       [* - if active Sieve]

*** Subscription. Single line response of the form:

  *** [name :: astring]

** Mailbox. Single line response of the form: 

  ** [uniqueid   :: astring]
     [name       :: astring]
     [acl        :: astring]
     [lastuid    :: ulong]
     [lastchange :: time_t]

* Message within last mailbox listed as a "**" item. Format is the
  same as that generated by STATUS command:

  * [uid :: ulong]
    [guid :: astring]
    [flags :: flag_list_t]
</pre>

Final line of successful response is used to report QUOTA information
in the same format:

<pre>
OK
  Limit                 :: quota_t   (Kbytes)
  expunged_timeout      :: ulong     (seconds) 
  expunged_vol_min      :: quota_t   (KBytes)
  expunged_vol_max      :: quota_t   (KBytes)
  expunged_vol_overflow :: quota_t   (KBytes)
  mailbox_limit         :: ulong     (KBytes)
</pre>
  
<hr>
<h4>USER_SOME</h4>
<pre>
  user     :: astring 
  mailbox1 :: astring
    . . .
  mailboxn :: astring
</pre>

Similar to USER_ALL command, but only returns mailbox and message lists
for given set of mailboxes. Doesn't return sieve or subscription info.

<hr>
<h4>UPLOAD_SIEVE</h4>
<pre>
  sieve_name :: astring
  sieve_file :: literal+
</pre>

Response on success:
<pre>
  Upload_sieve completed.
</pre>
